566,565.0,richard ayoade s  the double  comes to mind not necessarily a mindfuck kind of movie  just interestingly directed and and the plot is creative  it s about a shy man named simon james  played by jesse eisenberg in one of his best roles  imo  who works in an office and he s in love with the girl who works a few floors up  who also happens to live in the apartment across from his a man who looks exactly like him named james simon  also played by eisenberg  comes to work at his office and people instantly like his double better  because he s confident and smooth  but no one seems to notice that they look exactly alike  a couple other interesting ones that kind of fall into the same category are stranger than fiction and ruby sparks stranger than fiction is about a man who realizes that he has been the main character in someone else s novel his entire life  and sets out to find his author ruby sparks is about a novelist who writes himself  the perfect girlfriend  and she comes to life  and he has to deal with the repercussions of it ,d02ulm5,movies,entertainment,1455683818.0,games_and_movies,1.0,0.0,1,579,0.0
